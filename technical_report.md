Critique of Server/Client prototype

### Overview

### (Route Defining in example_server)

```python
ROUTES = (
    ('OPTIONS', r'.*', options_response),
    ('GET', r'/$', get_index),
    ('POST', r'/item$', post_item),
    ('GET', r'/item/(?P<id>\d+)$', get_item),
    ('DELETE', r'/item/(?P<id>\d+)$', delete_item),
    ('GET', r'/items$', get_items),
```

The way these routes are defined creates an issue. Looking especially at the options request. The code means that any option request received by the server will generate the same response. In order to create different response for different option request additional routes would have to be added in, meaning for large scale applications, this would be become unmaintainable.
