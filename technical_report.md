Technical Report
================


This report provides a comprehensive overview of the server and client developed in the initial assignment. Emphasizing a forward-looking perspective, the focus of this analysis lies in the identification of potential challenges and the formulation of recommendations tailored to both the client and server, particularly in scenarios involving deployment or the utilization of larger-scale versions. A critical aspect of the report involves an in-depth examination of the features inherent to the frameworks and languages employed in the development process. Beyond a mere evaluation, the report endeavors to furnish practical insights and informed suggestions for alternative frameworks that could be considered in a professional setting. By exploring the nuances of the implemented server and client, this report aims to offer a strategic perspective, guiding future decisions and actions in the deployment and scaling processes. The overarching objective is to provide a resource that not only addresses immediate concerns but also serves as a valuable reference for potential enhancements and adaptations in professional environments.


Critique of Server/Client prototype
---------------------

### Overview
()

### (Route Defining in example_server)

```python
ROUTES = (
    ('OPTIONS', r'.*', options_response),
    ('GET', r'/$', get_index),
    ('POST', r'/item$', post_item),
    ('GET', r'/item/(?P<id>\d+)$', get_item),
    ('DELETE', r'/item/(?P<id>\d+)$', delete_item),
    ('GET', r'/items$', get_items),
```

The way these routes are defined creates an issue. Looking especially at the options request. The code means that any option request received by the server will generate the same response. In order to create different response for different option request additional routes would have to be added in, meaning for large scale applications, this would be become unmaintainable.
